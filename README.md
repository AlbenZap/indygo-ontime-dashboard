## Problem Statement

Public transportation systems rely heavily on service reliability to maintain rider satisfaction, operational efficiency, and community trust. However, consistently delivering on-time service remains a significant challenge for transit agencies due to traffic congestion, operational constraints, and unforeseen disruptions. At IndyGo, there was a critical need for a comprehensive, accessible, and transparent method to measure and monitor On-Time Performance (OTP) across routes, service days, and timeframes. Without an intuitive and data-driven performance dashboard, identifying patterns, diagnosing service issues, and communicating performance to stakeholders remained cumbersome. This project addresses these challenges by developing an OTP Dashboard that leverages operational data sources, such as GPS trackers, Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs), and schedule adherence records, to provide actionable insights, enhance decision-making, and lay the groundwork for IndyGoâ€™s broader open data initiatives.
